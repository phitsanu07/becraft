# Response Format Skill

Define **standard response format** that ALL agents MUST use.

**Golden Rule:** *"If user asks a follow-up, your response wasn't complete enough."*

---

## 🔒 Pre-Response Checkpoint (REQUIRED)

Every response MUST start with:

```markdown
📚 **Skills Loaded:**
- skill-name-1 ✅ (brief what learned)
- skill-name-2 ✅ (brief what learned)

🤖 **Agent:** agent-name

💾 **Memory:** Loaded ✅ (9 files)

---

[Then continue with work...]
```

### Why This Matters
- Skipping checkpoint = didn't read skills = output quality drops
- Visible proof that protocol was followed
- Audit trail for debugging

---

## 📝 The 3-Section Format (MANDATORY)

Every completion response MUST end with these three sections:

### Section 1: ✅ What I Did
```markdown
## ✅ What I Did

**Files created:**
- `src/users/users.controller.ts` - POST /users endpoint
- `src/users/dto/create-user.dto.ts` - Validation DTO

**Files modified:**
- `src/app.module.ts` - Imported UsersModule

**Migrations:**
- `20260506_users` - Created users table

**Dependencies installed:**
- `bcrypt` - Password hashing
```

### Section 2: 🎁 What You Get
**User-perspective benefits, NOT technical implementation details**

```markdown
## 🎁 What You Get

- ✅ User registration endpoint working
- ✅ Email validation + password requirements
- ✅ Auto-generated OpenAPI docs
- ✅ Type-safe from API to DB

**Preview:** http://localhost:3000/docs
```

❌ **Bad** (technical perspective):
- "Created users.controller.ts using NestJS decorators"

✅ **Good** (user perspective):
- "User registration endpoint working with email validation"

### Section 3: 👉 What You Need To Do
**Three scenarios:**

**Scenario A: No action needed**
```markdown
## 👉 What You Need To Do

### Right now:
Nothing! ✨ Open http://localhost:3000/docs to see the new endpoint.

### Want to extend?
- Add password reset: tell me "add password reset"
- Add OAuth: tell me "add Google OAuth"
```

**Scenario B: User action required**
```markdown
## 👉 What You Need To Do

### Right now:
1. **Set DATABASE_URL** in `.env`:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/myapp
   ```
2. **Run migration:** `npx prisma migrate dev`
3. **Restart server:** `npm run start:dev`

⚠️ **Why?** Migration creates the users table — required before testing.
```

**Scenario C: Multiple options**
```markdown
## 👉 What You Need To Do

### Choose your path:

**Option A: Test with mock data first** (recommended)
- Nothing to do! Endpoint returns mock data for now

**Option B: Connect real database now**
1. Setup PostgreSQL
2. Run `npx prisma migrate dev`
3. Tell me "ready for real DB"
```

---

## 🎯 Context-Specific Templates

### After Schema Migration
```markdown
## ✅ What I Did
- Added `users` table (5 columns + indexes)
- Generated migration: `20260506_users`
- Updated `prisma/schema.prisma`

## 🎁 What You Get
- User entity ready for queries
- Type-safe Prisma client regenerated
- Indexes on email + created_at for fast queries

## 👉 What You Need To Do
1. **Apply migration:** `npx prisma migrate dev`
2. **Verify:** `npx prisma studio` (open DB GUI)
```

### After API Endpoint
```markdown
## ✅ What I Did
- POST `/api/v1/users` - Create user
- GET `/api/v1/users/:id` - Get user
- PATCH `/api/v1/users/:id` - Update user
- DELETE `/api/v1/users/:id` - Delete (soft)

**Files:**
- `src/users/users.controller.ts` (4 endpoints)
- `src/users/users.service.ts` (CRUD logic)
- `src/users/dto/*.ts` (3 DTOs)

## 🎁 What You Get
- Full CRUD for users
- Validation with class-validator
- OpenAPI docs at `/docs`
- Standard error responses (RFC 7807)

## 👉 What You Need To Do
Open http://localhost:3000/docs to test endpoints.

**Suggested next:**
- `/be-auth` - Add JWT authentication
- `/be-test` - Generate tests for these endpoints
```

### After Auth Setup
```markdown
## ✅ What I Did
- Setup JWT strategy (Passport)
- Added /auth/login + /auth/register
- Added @UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard) to protected routes
- Configured rate limiting on /auth/* (5 req/min)

## 🎁 What You Get
- Login + register working
- Protected routes return 401 if no token
- Rate limit prevents brute force
- Refresh token flow ready

## 👉 What You Need To Do

### Step 1: Set JWT_SECRET
Edit `.env`:
```
JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
```

### Step 2: Test
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"SecurePass123"}'
```

### Step 3: Continue
- Add OAuth: `/be-auth add Google OAuth`
- Add password reset: `/be-auth add password reset`
```

### After Test Setup
```markdown
## ✅ What I Did
- Generated 12 unit tests (services)
- Generated 8 integration tests (with Testcontainers)
- Setup Jest + Supertest config
- Coverage: 87% (above 80% target)

**Auto-fixed during run:**
- Selector mismatch in users.spec.ts → fixed
- Async timing in auth.spec.ts → added waitFor

## 🎁 What You Get
- All tests passing ✅
- Coverage report at `coverage/index.html`
- CI-ready test commands

## 👉 What You Need To Do
Nothing! Tests are passing. Run `npm test` anytime to verify.

**Suggested next:**
- `/be-deploy` - Setup CI/CD pipeline
- `/be-observe` - Add production monitoring
```

---

## ⚠️ Rules

### ALWAYS
- ✅ Include all 3 sections
- ✅ State what user must do (even "Nothing!")
- ✅ Provide preview URL when API created
- ✅ Explain WHY for non-obvious actions
- ✅ Anticipate follow-up questions

### NEVER
- ❌ End with just "Done!"
- ❌ Use technical jargon in "What You Get"
- ❌ Leave user guessing
- ❌ Skip required env var instructions
- ❌ Skip preview URL when applicable

---

## ✅ Pre-Response Checklist

Before sending, verify:
- [ ] Skills Loaded checkpoint at top?
- [ ] Memory loaded acknowledged?
- [ ] Agent identified?
- [ ] "✅ What I Did" section?
- [ ] "🎁 What You Get" section (user perspective)?
- [ ] "👉 What You Need To Do" section?
- [ ] If nothing needed, said "Nothing!" explicitly?
- [ ] Preview URL if API/UI changed?
- [ ] Can user act without asking questions?

If any fails → fix before sending!

---

## 🌐 Language Adaptation

Sections adapt to user language:

### English (default)
- ✅ What I Did
- 🎁 What You Get
- 👉 What You Need To Do

### Thai
- ✅ สิ่งที่ทำให้
- 🎁 สิ่งที่คุณได้
- 👉 สิ่งที่คุณต้องทำ

Code/CLI commands stay in English regardless.
